This is the start of a simple compiler which you should modify to
compile the MiniJava language.  The starter code is meant primarily to
show how the toolchain works and how the various parts of the compiler
project plug together.

To demonstrate the basics of scanning and parsing, as well as to
provide some basic structure, we're providing a demo-"compiler" that will
scan and parse "programs" in the following tiny toy programming language:

	program ::= statement | program statement
	statement ::= assignStmt | displayStmt
	assignStmt ::= id = expr ;
	displayStmt ::= display expr ;
	expr ::= id | expr + expr | ( expr )
	id ::= [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*

(Compare this to "Parser/minijava.cup".  Note: this is only meant to 
demonstrate the tools.  The source files will need changes, additions, 
and deletions for the actual minijava project.)

The AST classes provided are closely based on those on the MiniJava
website, slightly modified to add tracking of line numbers, as well as
adding a separate Display node only used in the toy language, but not
for MiniJava.  The AST classes have also been updated to use Lists with
type parameters instead of the original Vector class used in the code on
the MiniJava website.

All of the compiler source code is in the src directory.

The ScannerDemo and ParserDemo classes are examples of how to use the
scanner and parser.  You will need to create an actual MiniJava class
with the main program for your project, but the test code here should
provide some useful hints.  The rest of the compiler is stored in
several subdirectories:

    Scanner: the implementation of the demo scanner

    Parser: the implementation of the demo parser

    AST: the implementation of the abstract syntax tree

    runtime: interface between compiled code and C environment

    test: demo test cases and supporting files for the compiler

The lib directory stores the jar files for CUP and JFlex that are
needed to build and run the compiler, and a couple of source files from
CUP that may be useful for reference.

SamplePrograms contains "Example.java", a sample program in the 
above demo-language, which
you can replace with MiniJava programs to be compiled and run to test
your MiniJava compiler as you develop it.  The SampleMiniJavaPrograms
directory contains larger MiniJava programs for testing, mostly taken
from the MiniJava web site.

"build.xml" is an ant file supporting building, running, and testing the demo
compiler scanning and parsing examples.  Look at it for details and use
it as a start for your own project's build sequence.  You can find more
detailed documentation about testing your code in test/README.txt.
