CSE 401 18sp Project III - Semantics

False negative: an overridden method in a subclass must have the same argument type list as the superclass’s method. (-2)

False negative: an overridden method in a subclass must have either the same return type or a subclass of the return type in the original superclass method. (-2)

False negative: arrays can only be indexed with an integer. (-2)

False negative: A class cannot extend an undeclared superclass. (-2)

False negative: “!” can only be applied to booleans. (-2)

False negative: “System.out.println” can only take integer arguments. (-2)

False negative: return type in function header must match actual returned type. (-2)

The semantics checker crashed with a NullPointerException when trying to check a file where the method returned an undeclared type (-2)

Misleading error messages. (-1)

The project prints errors to stdout instead of stderr. (-1)

The compiler doesn’t always exit with status code 1 on errors/exceptions. (-2)

False negative: Checker doesn’t catch inheritance cycles. (-2)

False negative: Array elements (e.g., arr[0]) should only be assignable int types. (-2)

False negative: length function call should only be callable on int array types. (-2)

False negative: Expressions on both sides of ‘<’ should be of type int (not object types). (-2)

False negative: Arithmetic operators (e.g., minus and plus) should only work on integers. (-2)

False positive: Something like ‘arr[0] + arr[1] + arr.length’ should be valid, but the type checker rejects it. (-2)

False negative: && operators should only work on booleans. (-2)

False negative: The condition of an if and, or while statement must be a boolean. (-2)

Symbol table doesn’t indicate inheritance relationships. (-0)
